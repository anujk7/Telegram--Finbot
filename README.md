# ðŸ“ˆ GoQuant Telegram Finbot (Assignment Project)

This is a Telegram bot built in Python as part of the GoQuant backend assignment. The bot simulates a real-time trading information system using **dummy data**, mimicking the GoMarket API, and offers insights like arbitrage opportunities and consolidated market views across multiple exchanges.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features Implemented

### âœ… Arbitrage Signal Service
- Detects arbitrage opportunities between the same asset across multiple exchanges (using dummy prices).
- Allows configuration via Telegram using:  
  `/monitor_arb <symbol> <threshold>`  
  `/stop_arb`

### âœ… Consolidated Market View
- Calculates **CBBO** (Consolidated Best Bid/Offer) and mid-price.
- Identifies the best exchange to trade.
- Supports command:  
  `/get_cbbo <symbol>`  
  `/market <symbol>`

### âœ… Symbol Discovery
- Lists symbols from dummy GoMarket responses.
- Uses:  
  `/list_symbols <exchange>`

Assumptions
Real GoMarket APIs were replaced with dummy/static data due to HTTP 400 errors.

Arbitrage and CBBO logic are still fully functional on simulated data.

Simulated data mimics Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Deribit spot markets.
